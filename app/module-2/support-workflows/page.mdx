# Support Workflows

Support is where most solopreneurs feel the squeeze. You want to respond quickly, but thoughtful responses take time. Your CS agent solves this.

---

## The Support Problem

Without a system:
- You dread opening your inbox
- Simple questions take 10 minutes to answer
- You forget to follow up
- Quality varies based on your mood/energy

With your CS agent:
- Drafts ready in seconds
- Consistent quality every time
- Patterns get captured for next time
- You just review and send

---

## The Response Framework

Every support response follows this structure:

```
ACKNOWLEDGE → ANSWER → EXPAND → NEXT STEP
```

### 1. Acknowledge
Show you understand their situation. This isn't filler - it builds trust.

❌ "Thanks for reaching out."
✅ "I can see how that would be confusing - the course navigation isn't obvious at first."

### 2. Answer
Address their actual question directly. Don't bury the answer.

❌ [Three paragraphs before getting to the point]
✅ "Your recordings are in Dashboard → Past Sessions, labeled by date."

### 3. Expand
Anticipate what they'll ask next. Save them a follow-up email.

"You might also be wondering about downloads - yes, you can download any recording using the button in the bottom right of the video player."

### 4. Next Step
Every response ends with clarity on what happens next.

"If you still can't find the recording, let me know the session date and I'll send you a direct link."

## Exercise: Your First Support Response

Think of a real customer question you've received. Run this in Claude Code:

```
/cs-respond
Customer question: [Paste their actual question]
Context: [New customer? Long-time client? Frustrated?]
```

Review the output:
- Does it follow the ACKNOWLEDGE → ANSWER → EXPAND → NEXT STEP framework?
- Does it sound like you?
- What would you adjust?

## Adapting Tone by Situation

Your CS agent adjusts based on context:

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Simple question** | Efficient and friendly - respect their time |
| **Confused customer** | Patient, step-by-step, no jargon |
| **Frustrated customer** | Lead with empathy, focus on solution |
| **Happy customer** | Match their energy, be warm |

### Example: Same Question, Different Context

**Question:** "How do I access the bonus materials?"

**New customer (excited):**
> Welcome! So glad you're diving into the bonuses. You'll find them in your dashboard under "Bonus Resources" - there's some great stuff in there. My favorite is the template pack in section 2. Enjoy exploring!

**Confused customer (multiple emails):**
> I hear you - the dashboard can be overwhelming at first. Let me walk you through it step by step:
>
> 1. Log in at [URL]
> 2. Click "My Courses" in the top menu
> 3. Look for "Bonus Resources" in the left sidebar
>
> If you're not seeing that sidebar, try refreshing the page. Still stuck? Screenshot what you're seeing and I'll point you in the right direction.

## Handling Difficult Situations

Your CS agent knows when to escalate.

### Automatic Flags

These trigger an escalation warning:
- Customer mentions "refund" or "cancellation"
- Words like "upset," "frustrated," "disappointed"
- Billing or payment issues
- Technical problems agent can't solve
- Anything involving legal language

### What Escalation Looks Like

```
---
⚠️ ESCALATION FLAG

This response is drafted but needs your review because:
- Customer mentioned "really frustrated"
- Situation involves account access (billing-adjacent)

Recommendation: Review carefully before sending. Consider
a more personal response or direct outreach.
---
```

You decide what to do - the agent just makes sure you don't miss it.

---

## Building Response Patterns

As you review and edit drafts, notice patterns:

"For this type of question, I always..."
"When someone mentions X, I like to include..."
"My clients respond better when I..."

Add these to your CLAUDE.md or CS agent README:

```markdown
## Response Patterns

### Accessing Course Content
- Always include the direct URL
- Mention the "Resources" folder people often miss
- Offer to send a Loom walkthrough if they're still stuck

### Scheduling Questions
- Link to Calendly, don't describe the process
- Mention timezone: "All times shown in your local timezone"
```

Your agent gets smarter as you teach it.

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Give Context About the Customer

❌ "Respond to this email"
✅ "Respond to this email - she's a VIP client, very detail-oriented, been with us 2 years"

### 2. Specify the Outcome You Want

❌ "Answer their question"
✅ "Answer their question and invite them to the Q&A call on Thursday"

### 3. Reference History

❌ "They asked about pricing"
✅ "They asked about pricing - this is their second question, first was about time commitment"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Framework matters** - ACKNOWLEDGE → ANSWER → EXPAND → NEXT STEP
2. **Tone adapts** - Same answer, different delivery based on situation
3. **Escalation is automatic** - Agent flags sensitive issues
4. **Patterns compound** - Teach your agent what works
