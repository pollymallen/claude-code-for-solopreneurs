# FAQ Management

Every question you answer is an investment. With a FAQ system, you answer once and benefit forever.

## The FAQ Advantage

Without FAQ management:
- Answer the same question 50 times
- Answers vary in quality
- New questions start from scratch

With FAQ management:
- Answer once, reference forever
- Consistent, polished answers
- Agent checks FAQ before drafting

## How It Works

When you run `/cs-respond`, your CS agent:

1. Checks `/knowledge/faq.md` for existing answers
2. Uses relevant FAQ content in the response
3. Suggests adding new entries for repeated questions

Over time, your FAQ becomes a knowledge base that makes every response better.

## Creating Great FAQ Entries

### Rule 1: Write Questions as Customers Ask Them

❌ "Course Access and Navigation Procedures"
✅ "How do I find my course after I buy it?"

❌ "Refund Policy Information"
✅ "Can I get my money back if it's not for me?"

Use their language, not yours.

### Rule 2: Answer Completely

Don't make them click elsewhere or email again.

❌ "Contact support for details on our refund policy."
✅ "Yes, you have 14 days to request a full refund, no questions asked. Just email support@example.com with your order number and we'll process it within 48 hours."

### Rule 3: Include the "Why"

Context helps customers understand and reduces follow-ups.

❌ "Recordings are available 24 hours after the session."
✅ "Recordings are available 24 hours after the session. We add this delay to edit out any technical glitches and add chapter markers so you can jump to specific sections."

### Rule 4: Anticipate Variations

People ask the same thing different ways.

```markdown
## How do I reset my password?

**Also asked as:**
- "I forgot my password"
- "Can't log in"
- "Locked out of my account"
- "Password not working"
```

## Exercise: Create Your First FAQ Entry

Think of a question you get at least once a month. Run:

```
/cs-faq
Topic: [The question]
Common variations: [Other ways people ask this]
Context: [Any relevant details about your answer]
```

Review the output:
- Does it sound like how customers would ask?
- Is the answer complete?
- Would you send this to someone without editing?

## Organizing Your FAQ

Structure matters. Here's the recommended layout:

```markdown
# FAQ Knowledge Base

## Getting Started
Questions new customers ask in their first week.

## Account & Access
Login, password, technical access issues.

## Program/Product Specific
Questions about your actual offer.

## Billing & Payments
Money-related questions.

## Technical Issues
Platform, downloads, compatibility.
```

## The FAQ Workflow

### When You Answer a Question

1. **Check if it's common:** Have you answered this before?
2. **If yes:** Pull from FAQ, customize slightly
3. **If no:** Answer fresh, then ask yourself:

"Will I probably get this question again?"

If yes → Create an FAQ entry.

### Adding to Your FAQ

After drafting a response:

```
This question seems common. Should I add it to the FAQ?

Create an FAQ entry for: "How do I access bonus materials?"
with the answer I just drafted.
```

Your CS agent will format it properly and add it to `/knowledge/faq.md`.

## Advanced: FAQ Analytics

Track which FAQs get used most:

```markdown
## How do I reset my password?
*Used: 23 times | Last used: 2024-01-15*
```

This tells you:
- What to feature prominently on your website
- What problems might need a better solution
- Where to invest in better UX

## Connecting FAQ to Other Agents

Your FAQ isn't just for support. Other agents can use it too:

- **EA Agent:** Reference FAQ when drafting client emails
- **Content Agent:** Turn common FAQs into content ideas
- **Onboarding Agent:** Preemptively answer FAQ in welcome sequence

One knowledge base, many uses.
