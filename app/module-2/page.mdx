# Module 2: Customer Success Agent

Your second agent handles the customer-facing side of your business - support, onboarding, and building a knowledge base that makes your whole operation smarter.

---

## Why Customer Success?

As a solopreneur, customer support is often:
- **Repetitive** - Same questions, over and over
- **Time-sensitive** - People expect quick responses
- **Emotionally draining** - Especially when you're the only one

Your CS agent handles the repetitive parts while keeping your personal touch.

---

## What You'll Build

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| `/cs-respond` | Draft support responses in your voice |
| `/cs-faq` | Create and update FAQ entries |
| `/cs-onboard` | Design onboarding email sequences |
| Knowledge base | FAQ library that grows over time |

---

## The CS Philosophy

Unlike your EA (which is primarily internal), your CS agent talks to customers. This means:

1. **Voice matters more** - It must sound like you
2. **Empathy is required** - Acknowledge before solving
3. **Consistency builds trust** - Same quality every time
4. **Knowledge compounds** - Every answer makes the next one easier
