# Onboarding Sequences

First impressions matter. A great onboarding sequence gets customers to success faster and reduces support load later.

## Why Onboarding Matters

Good onboarding:
- Reduces refund requests
- Decreases support tickets
- Increases engagement and completion
- Builds relationship and trust

Bad onboarding (or no onboarding):
- Confused customers who never start
- Support emails asking "now what?"
- Buyer's remorse and refund requests
- Ghost customers who disappear

## Onboarding Principles

### 1. Start with the Win

Remind them what they'll achieve. They bought for a reason - reconnect them to it.

❌ "Welcome to the program! Here's everything you need to know..."
✅ "Welcome! In 12 weeks, you'll have a complete content system running on autopilot. Let's get you there."

### 2. One Action Per Email

Overwhelm is the enemy of action.

❌ "Here are 7 things to do in your first week..."
✅ "Your ONE task today: Complete your profile. Takes 3 minutes."

### 3. Build Momentum

Quick wins early. Harder stuff comes later when they're invested.

**Day 1:** Complete profile (2 min)
**Day 3:** Watch intro video (10 min)
**Day 5:** First real exercise (30 min)

### 4. Anticipate Confusion

Address common problems before they happen.

"BTW, if you can't find the Dashboard, look for the menu icon in the top left corner - it's easy to miss on mobile."

## The Onboarding Command

```
/cs-onboard
Customer type: New coaching client (12-week program)
Goal: Get them oriented and excited for first session
Emails needed: 4
Timeline: First 2 weeks
```

This generates a complete sequence you can customize.

## Anatomy of an Onboarding Sequence

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Goal:** Excitement + one quick win

- Confirm they made a great decision
- Give ONE small action (profile, intro video, etc.)
- Set expectations for what's next
- Sound human, not automated

### Email 2: Quick Win (Day 1-2)

**Goal:** Build momentum

- Check in on first action
- Give next step (still easy)
- Preview what they'll accomplish

### Email 3: Deeper Dive (Day 3-5)

**Goal:** Start the real work

- Transition to actual content/process
- Break it down step by step
- Anticipate common questions
- Offer help if stuck

### Email 4: Check-In (Day 7)

**Goal:** Catch strugglers

- "How's it going?"
- Provide off-ramp for common stuck points
- Celebrate those who've made progress
- Make it easy to reply

## Exercise: Draft Your Onboarding

Pick one customer segment and try:

```
/cs-onboard
Customer type: [Your main offer - e.g., "Course buyers" or "New coaching clients"]
Goal: [What does success look like after onboarding?]
Emails needed: [4-6 is typical]
Timeline: [First week? First 2 weeks?]
```

Review each email:
- Does it have ONE clear action?
- Does it sound like you?
- Would you open these subject lines?

## Onboarding Anti-Patterns

### The Information Dump

❌ "Here's everything you need to know about the program, all our policies, every resource available, and..."

They won't read it. They'll feel overwhelmed. They'll procrastinate.

### The Ghost

❌ [Purchase confirmation] ... [Nothing until they email with questions]

They'll forget they bought. They'll feel abandoned. They'll request refunds.

### The Spam Cannon

❌ [Day 1: Email] [Day 2: Email] [Day 3: Email] [Day 4: Email]...

They'll unsubscribe. They'll feel harassed. They'll associate you with noise.

## Onboarding Triggers Beyond "New Purchase"

Your CS agent can create sequences for other triggers:

| Trigger | Sequence Goal |
|---------|---------------|
| Course completion | Upsell or testimonial request |
| Inactivity (7 days) | Re-engagement |
| Milestone hit | Celebration + next level |
| Approaching renewal | Retention |

---

## Personalizing at Scale

Even automated sequences can feel personal:

### Personalization Points

- **Name** (obviously)
- **What they bought** ("your Clarity Coaching journey")
- **Their goal** (if captured at purchase)
- **Time-based** ("It's been a week since...")

### The Human Touch

Schedule these for personal sends:
- Day 3: Brief personal welcome video (30 seconds)
- Day 14: Quick "how's it going?" from your actual email

Mix automated + personal = best of both worlds.

## Measuring Onboarding Success

Track these signals:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Open rates by email | Which emails get ignored |
| Click rates | Which CTAs work |
| First action completion | Is quick win working? |
| Support tickets in week 1 | Is onboarding clear? |
| Day 7 engagement | Are they sticking? |

Adjust sequences based on what the data shows.

But first, practice:
1. Use `/cs-respond` for your next 5 support emails
2. Add at least 3 FAQ entries to your knowledge base
3. Draft an onboarding sequence for your main offer
