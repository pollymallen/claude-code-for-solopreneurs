# Designing Your EA

Before we write any commands, let's think through what makes a good Executive Assistant agent.

---

## The Design Framework

Every agent needs four things:

| Component | Question to Answer |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Context** | What does this agent need to know? |
| **Capabilities** | What tasks can it handle? |
| **Constraints** | What should it NOT do? |
| **Communication** | How should it interact with you? |

Let's work through each for your EA.

## Context: What Does Your EA Need to Know?

Your EA needs access to:

### From CLAUDE.md (already set up)
- Your business description
- Your brand voice and tone
- Key facts about your work

### EA-Specific Context
Things that help with administrative tasks:

```markdown
## EA Context

### Key Relationships
- [Client name] - Current coaching client, high-touch
- [Partner name] - Referral partner, informal tone
- [Vendor name] - Keep professional

### Common Topics
- 12-week coaching program ($5,000)
- Group program launching Q2
- Podcast publishes Tuesdays

### Scheduling Preferences
- No meetings before 10am
- Discovery calls are 30 min
- Client sessions are 60 min
```

**Exercise:** Add an "EA Context" section to your CLAUDE.md with 3-5 key relationships and common topics.

## Capabilities: What Can Your EA Do?

Start with tasks that are:
- **Repetitive** - You do them often
- **Low-stakes** - Easy to review and correct
- **Time-consuming** - Worth automating

### Good EA Tasks

| Task | Why It Works |
|------|--------------|
| Email drafting | Repetitive, low-risk, easy to review |
| Research | Time-consuming, structured output |
| Meeting prep | Repetitive format, high value |
| Data formatting | Tedious, low judgment needed |

### Bad EA Tasks (For Now)

| Task | Why It Doesn't Work |
|------|---------------------|
| Sending emails | No undo if wrong |
| Negotiating | Requires your judgment |
| Financial decisions | Too high stakes |
| Strategic planning | Needs your expertise |

---

## Constraints: What Should Your EA NOT Do?

This is the most important part of agent design. Clear boundaries prevent disasters.

### Your EA Should NOT:

1. **Send anything** - Always draft, never send
2. **Make commitments** - "I'll check with [you]" not "Yes, we can do that"
3. **Access sensitive files** - Financial docs, contracts without permission
4. **Handle conflict** - Complaints or disputes escalate to you

### Escalation Triggers

Train your EA to flag these:

```markdown
## Escalate to Me When:
- Email involves money or contracts
- Someone seems upset or is complaining
- You're unsure about the relationship context
- Strategic positioning is needed
- Request is outside normal scope
```

**Exercise:** Write your escalation triggers. What situations need your direct attention?

---

## Communication: How Should Your EA Work With You?

### Output Preferences

Tell your EA how you like to receive work:

```markdown
## How I Want Output:

### Emails
- Give me 2-3 versions (short, medium, detailed)
- Note the tone you chose and why
- Flag anything that needs my review

### Research
- Lead with key takeaways (3 bullet points)
- Details below for reference
- Always cite sources

### Meeting Prep
- One-page max
- Focus on what I need to know, not everything
- Include 3 questions I should ask
```

### Feedback Loop

Your EA gets better when you tell it what worked:

```
Good: "The short version was perfect, use that length for [client] in the future"
Good: "Too formal - [client] is casual, first-name basis"
Good: "Add this to my CLAUDE.md: always mention the podcast when..."
```

## Exercise: Design Your EA

Open your starter repo and complete these steps:

### Step 1: Update CLAUDE.md

Add an EA Context section with:
- 3-5 key relationships
- Common topics you discuss
- Your scheduling preferences

### Step 2: Review the EA README

Open `/agents/executive-assistant/README.md` and:
- Read through the instructions
- Modify anything that doesn't fit your style
- Add any missing context

### Step 3: Test the Context

In Claude Code:
```
Read my CLAUDE.md and the EA README. Then describe how you would
draft an email to a potential coaching client who reached out
after hearing my podcast.
```

Does Claude understand your context? If not, what's missing?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context is everything** - The more your EA knows, the less you explain
2. **Constraints prevent disasters** - Clear boundaries = safe delegation
3. **Start conservative** - You can expand capabilities later
4. **Iterate based on feedback** - Your EA improves as you use it
