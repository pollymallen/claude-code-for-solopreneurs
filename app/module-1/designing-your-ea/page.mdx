# Designing Your EA

Before building, let's establish what makes a good Executive Assistant agent.

## The Design Framework

Every agent needs six things:

| Component | Question to Answer |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Context** | What does this agent need to know? |
| **Capabilities** | What tasks can it handle? |
| **Tools** | What can it use to take action? |
| **Memory** | How does it remember things? |
| **Constraints** | What should it NOT do? |
| **Communication** | How should it interact with you? |

In V0, you'll define most of this manually. In V1, your EA will discover much of it from your actual email and calendar.

## V0: What You Need to Provide

For the manual version, you need to give your EA:

### 1. Business Context (CLAUDE.md)

Your EA reads CLAUDE.md at the start of every session. Include:
- What your business does
- Your brand voice and tone
- Key facts (offers, pricing if relevant, platforms you use)

### 2. Communication Style

How do you typically communicate?

```markdown
## Communication Style

**Tone:** Professional but warm
**Email length:** Short and direct (2-3 paragraphs max)
**Signature:** "Best, [Name]"
**Avoid:** Exclamation points, "just following up"
```

### 3. Key Relationships (Optional for V0)

Who are your most important contacts?

```markdown
## Key Relationships

- Sarah Chen - VIP coaching client, very casual
- Alex Rivera - Referral partner, professional
- [Vendor] - Keep formal
```

> **Note:** In V1, your EA will discover your frequent contacts automatically and ask you to classify them.

## EA Capabilities (V0)

Your V0 EA handles reactive tasks:

| Task | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Email drafting** | You paste an email, EA drafts a reply |
| **Research** | You ask a question, EA researches and summarizes |
| **Meeting prep** | You provide context, EA creates an agenda |

### What V0 Can't Do (Yet)

- Read your inbox directly
- File or move emails
- Send anything
- Access your calendar
- Work proactively

These require V1 (MCP connections).

## Constraints: What Your EA Should NOT Do

This is the most important part. Clear boundaries prevent disasters.

### Your EA Should NOT:

1. **Send anything** - Always draft, never send
2. **Make commitments** - "I'll check with [you]" not "Yes, we can do that"
3. **Handle conflict** - Complaints or disputes escalate to you
4. **Access sensitive info** - Financial docs, contracts without permission

### Escalation Triggers

```markdown
## Escalate to Me When:
- Email involves money or contracts
- Someone seems upset or complaining
- Unsure about the relationship context
- Strategic positioning is needed
```

---

## Exercise: Minimum Viable Context

To get your V0 EA working, add this to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## EA Context

### Communication Style
Tone: [Professional/Casual/etc.]
Email length preference: [Short/Medium/Detailed]
Sign-off: [How you end emails]

### Escalate to Me When
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]
- [Situation 3]
```

That's enough to start. You'll refine as you use it.

## Key Takeaways

1. **V0 is manual but valuable** - You provide context, EA saves you time
2. **Start minimal** - You can add more context later
3. **Constraints matter most** - Clear boundaries prevent mistakes
4. **V1 will be easier** - EA discovers context automatically
