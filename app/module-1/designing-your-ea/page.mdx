# Designing Your EA

Before building, let's establish what makes a good Executive Assistant agent.

---

## The Design Framework

Every agent needs six things:

| Component | Where It Lives |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Context** | `CLAUDE.md` - Your business info, brand voice |
| **Capabilities** | `agents/executive-assistant/README.md` - What the EA does |
| **Tools** | Commands in `.claude/commands/` |
| **Memory** | Files the EA reads/writes (templates, drafts) |
| **Constraints** | `agents/executive-assistant/README.md` - What NOT to do |
| **Communication** | `agents/executive-assistant/README.md` - Output preferences |

In V0, you'll customize these manually. In V1, your EA will discover much of this from your actual email.

---

## What Goes Where

### CLAUDE.md (Business Context)

This is your business identity. All agents read it. Include:
- What your business does
- Your brand voice and tone
- Key facts (offers, platforms you use)

**Don't put EA-specific instructions here.** That goes in the EA's own README.

### agents/executive-assistant/README.md (EA Instructions)

This is where your EA learns how to behave:
- How to draft emails
- How to format research
- What to escalate
- Where to save files

---

## V0 Capabilities

Your V0 EA handles reactive tasks:

| Task | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Email drafting** | You paste an email, EA drafts a reply |
| **Research** | You ask a question, EA researches and summarizes |
| **Meeting prep** | You provide context, EA creates an agenda |

### What V0 Can't Do (Yet)

- Read your inbox directly
- File or move emails
- Send anything
- Access your calendar
- Work proactively

These require V1 (MCP connections).

## Exercise: Customize Your EA

Let's make this real. Open your terminal and follow along.

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Repo

```bash
cd ~/Documents/your-repo-name  # wherever you cloned it
```

If you haven't created your repo yet, go back to [Installation](/module-0/installation) and complete Step 4.

### Step 2: Open the EA README

The file you'll customize is:

```
agents/executive-assistant/README.md
```

Open it in your editor. You'll see sections for:
- What this agent does
- Agent instructions
- Boundaries
- Example prompts

### Step 3: Customize the Boundaries

Find the "Boundaries" section. Update the escalation triggers for your business:

```markdown
**Escalate to you when:**
- [What situations need your personal attention?]
- [What topics are too sensitive for the EA?]
- [What relationships require your direct involvement?]
```

**Example for a coach:**
```markdown
**Escalate to you when:**
- Email involves pricing or payment issues
- Someone mentions refund or cancellation
- VIP client (anyone in your program) has a concern
- Media or partnership inquiries
```

### Step 4: Set Your Output Preferences

Find the "Email Drafting Rules" section. Adjust to match how you write:

```markdown
### Email Drafting Rules

1. **Provide 2 versions** - Short and detailed (I'll pick one)
2. **Tone:** Professional but warm, no exclamation points
3. **Length:** Keep it short - 2-3 paragraphs max
4. **Sign-off:** "Best, [Your Name]"
```

### Step 5: Add Memory (Where to Save Files)

At the bottom of the README, update the "Files This Agent Uses" section:

```markdown
## Files This Agent Uses

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/CLAUDE.md` | Business context, brand voice |
| `/drafts/` | Save email drafts here for my review |
| `/research/` | Save research briefs here |
| `/templates/email-response.md` | Email templates |
```

### Step 6: Test It

Start Claude Code in your repo:

```bash
claude
```

Then try:

```
Read the EA README at agents/executive-assistant/README.md.
Then draft a follow-up email to a potential client named Sarah
who attended my free masterclass last week.
```

Does the output match your preferences? If not, adjust the README.

## Key Takeaways

1. **CLAUDE.md = business context** - Who you are, brand voice
2. **EA README = agent instructions** - How the EA should behave
3. **Start with boundaries** - What NOT to do is most important
4. **Test and refine** - The EA improves as you clarify instructions
