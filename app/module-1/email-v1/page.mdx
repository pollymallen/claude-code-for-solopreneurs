# Email V1: Connected Email

In V0, you pasted emails and copied drafts. In V1, your EA connects directly to Gmail.

---

## What V1 Unlocks

| V0 (Manual) | V1 (Connected) |
|-------------|----------------|
| Paste email into Claude Code | EA reads your inbox directly |
| Copy draft, paste into Gmail | Draft appears in Gmail Drafts folder |
| Tell EA about the sender | EA sees the full thread and context |
| Decide where to file | EA files based on your rules |

---

## What You Need

1. **Gmail account** - Personal or Google Workspace
2. **Gmail MCP server** - Connects Claude Code to Gmail
3. **~15 minutes** - For setup and authorization

---

## Step 1: Install the Gmail MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Claude Code connect to external services. For Gmail, we'll use the Google Workspace MCP server.

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/mcp-server-google-workspace
```

### Configure Claude Code

Add the MCP server to your Claude Code config. Open (or create) `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "google-workspace": {
    "command": "mcp-server-google-workspace",
    "args": ["--scopes", "gmail.readonly,gmail.modify,gmail.labels"]
  }
}
```

---

## Step 2: Authorize Gmail Access

Start Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/your-repo-name
claude
```

The first time you use a Gmail command, Claude Code will:
1. Open a browser window
2. Ask you to sign in to Google
3. Request permission to read and manage your email

Grant access. This is a one-time setup.

---

## Step 3: Discover Your Email Patterns

Now for the magic. Your EA can examine your inbox and learn:

```
Look at my Gmail inbox and tell me:
1. Who are my most frequent contacts (top 10)?
2. What labels/folders do I have?
3. What patterns do you see in how I organize email?
```

Your EA will analyze your inbox and propose:
- Key relationships to remember
- Filing rules based on your existing folders
- Patterns it noticed

**Review and refine.** The EA is proposing, you're confirming.

---

## Step 4: Create Filing Rules

Based on what your EA discovered, create an email filing SOP:

```
Based on what you learned about my inbox, create a filing SOP.
Save it to /sops/email-filing.md

Include:
- When to file to each folder
- What stays in inbox
- What gets archived
- What needs my attention flagged
```

Your EA creates the SOP, you review and adjust.

---

## Step 5: Use Connected Email Commands

Now your email commands work directly with Gmail:

### Read and Draft

```
/ea-email-v1
Check my inbox for anything that needs a response today.
Draft replies and save them to my Gmail Drafts folder.
```

### Triage Inbox

```
/ea-inbox-triage
Review my inbox and:
- File obvious items (receipts, newsletters, etc.)
- Flag items that need my attention
- Leave uncertain items for me to review
```

---

## The Daily Workflow (V1)

Your new morning routine:

1. **Start Claude Code** in your repo
2. **Run inbox triage** - EA files what it can, flags what needs you
3. **Review flagged items** - The stuff that actually needs your brain
4. **Draft responses** - EA drafts, saves to Gmail Drafts
5. **Review and send** - You approve and send from Gmail

You go from "drowning in email" to "reviewing what matters."

---

## What V1 Can't Do (Yet)

- **Send emails** - Still requires your approval in Gmail
- **Handle calendar** - That's a separate MCP connection
- **Learn from corrections** - V2 adds self-improvement

---

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found"

Make sure you installed globally:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/mcp-server-google-workspace
```

### "Authorization failed"

Check that you're signing into the correct Google account. If using Google Workspace, your admin may need to approve the app.

### "Can't access inbox"

The scopes in your config may be wrong. Make sure you have:
- `gmail.readonly` - To read emails
- `gmail.modify` - To move/label emails
- `gmail.labels` - To work with folders

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCP connects Claude to your real tools** - Gmail is just the start
2. **EA discovers your patterns** - Instead of you documenting everything
3. **Filing becomes automatic** - Based on rules you confirm, not create from scratch

---

## What's Next

With V1, your EA works with your real inbox. In V2, we'll add:
- Daily Slack summaries
- Proactive triage (runs automatically)
- Self-improvement from your edits
