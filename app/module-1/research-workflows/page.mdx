# Research Workflows

Research is the hidden time sink for solopreneurs. Let's fix that.

## The Research Problem

Before every sales call, podcast interview, or strategic decision, you need information:

- Who is this person?
- What's their company doing?
- What's happening in their industry?
- What should I know before this conversation?

This takes 15-30 minutes per task. Multiply by dozens of tasks per week...

## How EA Research Works

Instead of scattered browser tabs, you get structured briefs:

```
/ea-research
Topic: Sarah Chen, CEO of Bloom Marketing
Goal: Prepare for strategy call Thursday
Depth: Moderate - enough to have informed conversation
```

**Output:** A saved research brief with:
- Key takeaways at the top
- Detailed findings below
- Sources cited
- Gaps noted

---

## Research Workflow #1: Person Research

Before any important conversation.

### The Command

```
/ea-research
Topic: [Person's name and role]
Goal: Prepare for [type of conversation]
Include:
- Background and career history
- Their company and what it does
- Recent news or activity
- Potential talking points
```

### What You Get

```markdown
# Research Brief: Sarah Chen, CEO of Bloom Marketing

## Key Takeaways
1. Founded Bloom Marketing in 2019, grown to 15 employees
2. Recently spoke at Marketing Week about sustainable growth
3. Active on LinkedIn - posts about work-life balance for founders

## Background
[Details with LinkedIn and company website citations]

## Talking Points
- Her recent conference talk (shows you did homework)
- Sustainable growth philosophy (aligns with your approach)
- Team scaling challenges (potential pain point)
```

---

## Research Workflow #2: Topic Research

When you need to understand something quickly.

### The Command

```
/ea-research
Topic: Current trends in coaching industry pricing
Goal: Inform my pricing strategy for new group program
Depth: Comprehensive - I need data and examples
```

### What You Get

- Industry benchmarks with citations
- Examples of what competitors charge
- Trends in pricing models
- Recommendations based on findings

---

## Research Workflow #3: Competitive Research

Know what others in your space are doing.

### The Command

```
/ea-research
Topic: Top 5 competitors in [your niche]
Goal: Understand positioning and identify gaps
Focus on:
- Their core offers and pricing
- How they position themselves
- What they do well
- Gaps I could fill
```

### Output Structure

Your EA creates a comparison table plus analysis:

| Competitor | Core Offer | Price Point | Positioning | Gap |
|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Competitor A | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Exercise: Your First Research Brief

Try this now:

```
/ea-research
Topic: [Someone you're meeting with this week]
Goal: Prepare for our conversation on [date]
Depth: Quick overview - 10 minute read
```

Review the output:
- Is it structured clearly?
- Are sources cited?
- What would you add or remove?

Save the brief to `/research/[name]-[date].md` if you want to keep it.

---

## Building a Research Library

Over time, you'll accumulate research. Organize it:

```
/research/
├── people/
│   ├── sarah-chen-2024-01.md
│   └── john-smith-2024-02.md
├── competitors/
│   └── competitor-analysis-q1.md
├── industry/
│   └── coaching-trends-2024.md
└── topics/
    └── pricing-research.md
```

Tell your EA to check existing research before doing new research:

```
Before researching, check if there's existing research in /research/
that's still relevant. Update rather than duplicate.
```

## Research Quality Tips

### Be Specific About Depth

| Depth | Time | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| Quick | 5 min read | Basic context before a call |
| Moderate | 15 min read | Important meeting prep |
| Comprehensive | 30+ min read | Strategic decisions |

### Tell EA What Matters

❌ "Research this company"
✅ "Research this company - I care most about their growth stage and culture fit for partnership"

### Request the Format You Need

```
Format this as:
- One-page summary I can read in 5 minutes
- Bullet points, not paragraphs
- Key stats highlighted
```

---

## When Research Gets Stale

Add date awareness to your EA:

```markdown
# In your EA instructions:

## Research Freshness
- People research: Valid for ~3 months
- Company research: Valid for ~1 month
- Industry trends: Valid for ~6 months
- Always check for recent news before important meetings
```

---

## Combining Research + Email

Your EA can chain tasks:

```
First, research [person] to prepare for our call.
Then, draft a pre-meeting email that references something
specific from the research to show I've done my homework.
```

This is the compound effect of having an agent vs. using AI for one-off tasks.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structured > scattered** - Research briefs beat browser tabs
2. **Save your research** - Build a library you can reference
3. **Specify depth** - Match research effort to importance
4. **Chain tasks** - Research can feed into other EA tasks
