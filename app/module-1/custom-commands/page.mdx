# Custom Commands

Custom commands are the magic that turns Claude Code from "AI tool" into "trained staff."

---

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are shortcuts that:
- Load specific instructions
- Set context automatically
- Accept your input as parameters
- Produce consistent output

Instead of explaining what you want every time:
```
Read my CLAUDE.md, then read the EA README, then draft an email
following these guidelines...
```

You just type:
```
/ea-email Sarah Chen - follow up on coaching call
```

---

## How Custom Commands Work

Commands are markdown files in `.claude/commands/`. The file name becomes the command.

```
.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── ea-email.md       →  /ea-email
    ├── ea-research.md    →  /ea-research
    └── ea-meeting-prep.md →  /ea-meeting-prep
```

When you run `/ea-email`, Claude Code:
1. Reads the command file
2. Replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with whatever you typed after the command
3. Executes the instructions

---

## Anatomy of a Command File

Let's break down `/ea-email`:

```markdown
# EA Email Command

You are acting as the Executive Assistant agent.
Your task is to draft a professional email.

## Instructions

1. First, read `/CLAUDE.md` for business context
2. Read `/agents/executive-assistant/README.md` for guidelines
3. Draft the email following the rules below

## Email Drafting Rules

- Provide 2-3 versions: Short, Medium, Detailed
- Match formality to relationship
- End with clear next step
- Write specific subject lines

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments provided, ask:
1. Who is the recipient?
2. What is the purpose?

## Output Format

[Template for consistent output]

## Boundaries

- Do NOT send the email
- Do NOT make commitments
```

### Key Parts

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Role statement | "You are acting as..." sets the persona |
| Instructions | Step-by-step what to do |
| Rules | How to do it well |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | Where your input goes |
| Output format | Consistent structure |
| Boundaries | What NOT to do |

## Exercise: Create Your First Custom Command

Let's create a command from scratch.

### Step 1: Identify a Repeatable Task

Think of something you do often that could be templated:
- Weekly newsletter draft
- Client check-in email
- Social media caption
- Meeting notes summary

### Step 2: Write the Command File

Create `.claude/commands/[your-task].md`:

```markdown
# [Task Name] Command

You are acting as [appropriate agent/role].
Your task is to [what this command does].

## Instructions

1. Read `/CLAUDE.md` for context
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Rules

- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments provided, ask:
1. [What you need to know]

## Output Format

[How the output should be structured]
```

### Step 3: Test It

```
/[your-command] [test input]
```

Does it work? What needs adjusting?

## Your EA Commands (Pre-Built)

Check your starter repo - these are ready to use:

### /ea-email
```
/ea-email
Recipient: [name, context]
Purpose: [what you want to accomplish]
```

### /ea-research
```
/ea-research
Topic: [what to research]
Goal: [why you need this]
```

### /ea-meeting-prep
```
/ea-meeting-prep
Meeting: [who and what]
Goal: [desired outcome]
```

## Command Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Transformer

Takes one thing, produces another.

```markdown
# Transform Command

Take $ARGUMENTS and transform it into [output format].

## Input
[Raw content, notes, ideas]

## Output
[Polished version in specific format]
```

**Examples:**
- Voice notes → bullet points
- Meeting notes → action items
- Ideas → outline

### Pattern 2: The Generator

Creates something from minimal input.

```markdown
# Generate Command

Generate [type of content] about $ARGUMENTS.

## Parameters
- Length: [specification]
- Tone: [from CLAUDE.md]
- Format: [template]
```

**Examples:**
- Generate social post
- Generate email sequence
- Generate FAQ entries

### Pattern 3: The Analyzer

Examines something and provides insights.

```markdown
# Analyze Command

Analyze $ARGUMENTS and provide:
1. Summary
2. Key insights
3. Recommendations
```

**Examples:**
- Analyze competitor website
- Analyze email thread
- Analyze sales call notes

---

## Pro Tips for Commands

### 1. Always Reference Context

```markdown
## Instructions
1. First, read `/CLAUDE.md` for business context
```

This ensures your brand voice is applied.

### 2. Handle Missing Arguments

```markdown
## Input
$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments provided, ask:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
```

Makes commands usable even when you forget details.

### 3. Define Output Clearly

Vague output = inconsistent results.

```markdown
## Output Format

```
SUBJECT: [Specific subject]

---

## Version 1: Short
[Content]

## Version 2: Detailed
[Content]

---

NOTES: [Context and suggestions]
```
```

### 4. Include Boundaries

```markdown
## Boundaries

- Do NOT [dangerous action]
- Always [safety measure]
- Flag if [escalation trigger]
```

---

## Exercise: Build Your Command Library

By the end of this module, you should have:

- [ ] `/ea-email` - Working and tested
- [ ] `/ea-research` - Working and tested
- [ ] `/ea-meeting-prep` - Working and tested
- [ ] At least 1 custom command you created

Test each one with real tasks. Note what works and what needs improvement.

---

## Module 1 Complete!

You now have:
- ✅ A designed EA agent with clear context and boundaries
- ✅ Email workflows that save you hours
- ✅ Research workflows for any topic
- ✅ Custom commands for instant access

---

## What's Next

In Module 2, you'll build your **Customer Success agent** - handling support, FAQs, and customer communications.

But first, spend a few days actually using your EA. The more you use it, the more you'll know what to improve.

**Homework:**
1. Use `/ea-email` for 5 real emails this week
2. Use `/ea-research` before your next important meeting
3. Note what worked and what needs adjustment
4. Update your CLAUDE.md based on learnings
