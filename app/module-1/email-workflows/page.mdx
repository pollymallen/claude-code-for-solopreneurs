# Email Drafting (V0)

Your EA's first superpower: drafting emails that sound like you.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

Fair question. Here's the difference:

| ChatGPT | Claude Code EA |
|---------|----------------|
| Re-explain your business every time | CLAUDE.md is always loaded |
| Copy-paste the output | Saves to your local files |
| Remember to ask for "3 versions" | `/ea-email` always does this |
| Generic AI voice | Your brand voice is baked in |
| Starts fresh each chat | Context compounds over time |

The V0 EA isn't magic - it's **convenience that compounds**. Every time you use it, you're working with your context, not rebuilding it.

## The Workflow

Here's exactly how to use your EA for email drafting:

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Your Repo

```bash
cd ~/Documents/your-repo-name
```

This is where your CLAUDE.md lives. Claude Code reads it automatically when you start.

### Step 2: Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

You'll see Claude Code start up. Your CLAUDE.md is now loaded.

### Step 3: Use the Email Command

```
/ea-email
Recipient: Sarah Chen (attended my masterclass last week)
Purpose: Follow up, see if she's interested in coaching
```

### Step 4: Review the Output

You'll get 3 versions (short, medium, detailed) plus a subject line. Pick one, edit if needed, send from your email client.

That's it. No re-explaining your business. No asking for multiple versions. The command handles it.

## Example: Real Email Drafts

### Follow-up After a Call

```
/ea-email
Recipient: Alex Rivera (discovery call yesterday, interested in Blueprint)
Purpose: Follow up with next steps and proposal
```

Your EA knows "Blueprint" is your 8-week program (from CLAUDE.md) and drafts accordingly.

### Cold Inquiry Response

```
/ea-email
Recipient: Unknown - cold inbound from website contact form
Purpose: They asked about coaching, qualify and suggest a call
Context: They mentioned struggling with AI adoption at their company
```

### Tricky Situation

```
/ea-email
Recipient: Current client (good relationship)
Purpose: They asked for a discount on renewal, need to decline gracefully
Note: This is sensitive, I'll edit heavily
```

Your EA will flag this for extra review and draft something you can refine.

## When to Edit vs. Send As-Is

**Usually send as-is:**
- Routine follow-ups
- Simple scheduling
- Thank-you notes
- Information requests

**Always edit first:**
- Anything involving money
- Complaints or sensitive topics
- New or fragile relationships
- Strategic positioning

The EA flags sensitive emails automatically.

## Exercise: Draft Your First Email

Open your terminal and try this now:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/your-repo-name  # your repo folder
claude
```

Then:

```
/ea-email
Recipient: [Someone you actually need to email this week]
Purpose: [What you need to say]
```

Review the output:
- Does it sound like you?
- Is the tone right?
- What would you change?

If something's off, the fix is in your CLAUDE.md (brand voice) or the command itself.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context is always loaded** - That's the advantage over ChatGPT
2. **Commands embed your preferences** - 3 versions, your tone, every time
3. **Start using it for real emails** - The value is in daily use, not setup
