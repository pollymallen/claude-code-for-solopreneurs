# Email Workflows

Email is the killer app for your EA. Let's build workflows that save you hours every week.

## The Email Problem

As a solopreneur, you probably:
- Spend 1-2 hours daily on email
- Write similar responses repeatedly
- Procrastinate on emails that need thought
- Wish you had someone to draft for you

Your EA solves this. Not by sending emails (too risky), but by having drafts ready for your review.

## Email Workflow #1: The Follow-Up

The most common email you write: following up after a conversation.

### Without EA
1. Remember you need to follow up
2. Open email, stare at blank screen
3. Try to remember what you discussed
4. Write email from scratch
5. Second-guess your wording
6. Finally send (30 min later)

### With EA
```
/ea-email
Recipient: Sarah Chen (discovery call yesterday, interested in coaching)
Purpose: Follow up, share next steps for working together
```

**Output:** 2-3 draft versions ready to review and send in 2 minutes.

## Exercise: Your First Email Draft

Try this now in Claude Code:

```
Read /agents/executive-assistant/README.md and /CLAUDE.md.

Then draft a follow-up email:
- Recipient: [Someone you actually need to email]
- Context: [Brief description of your last interaction]
- Purpose: [What you want to happen next]

Give me 3 versions: short, medium, and detailed.
```

**Review the output:**
- Does it sound like you?
- Is the tone right for this relationship?
- What would you change?

Tell Claude what to adjust, then update your CLAUDE.md with any patterns you notice.

## Email Workflow #2: The Cold Response

Someone reaches out cold - a potential client, podcast pitch, partnership inquiry.

### The Challenge
- You don't know them
- You need to qualify quickly
- Wrong tone = lost opportunity

### EA Approach
```
/ea-email
Recipient: Unknown - cold inbound from website contact form
Context: They asked about coaching, mentioned struggling with scaling
Purpose: Qualify interest, suggest discovery call if good fit
```

Your EA will:
1. Keep it professional but warm
2. Acknowledge their specific pain point
3. Suggest a clear next step
4. Not over-commit or under-commit

---

## Email Workflow #3: The Difficult Response

Emails you've been avoiding because they're tricky:
- Saying no to something
- Addressing a complaint
- Navigating a sensitive topic

### EA Approach

Your EA won't handle these alone, but it can give you a starting point:

```
/ea-email
Recipient: [Client name] - existing client, good relationship
Context: They asked for a discount on renewal
Purpose: Decline gracefully while maintaining relationship
Note: This is sensitive, I'll heavily edit

Give me a draft that:
- Acknowledges the ask warmly
- Explains why I can't discount
- Offers an alternative if possible
- Keeps the relationship strong
```

**Key:** You're still doing the thinking. The EA handles the first draft so you're not staring at a blank page.

## Building Your Email Patterns

Over time, you'll notice patterns. Capture them.

### Pattern: Discovery Call Follow-Up

```markdown
# In your CLAUDE.md or a templates file:

## Email Pattern: Post-Discovery Call

Structure:
1. Thank them for their time
2. Recap the main pain point they shared
3. Briefly state how I can help
4. Clear next step (proposal, second call, etc.)
5. Warm close

Tone: Confident but not pushy
Length: Short - they're busy
```

Now your EA knows exactly how to draft this type of email.

## Exercise: Map Your Email Patterns

List your 5 most common email types:

1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
4. _______________
5. _______________

For each one, note:
- Who receives this email?
- What's the typical structure?
- What tone works best?
- What's the desired outcome?

Add at least one pattern to your CLAUDE.md or create a file in `/templates/`.

## Pro Tips for Email Workflows

### 1. Give Relationship Context

❌ "Email to John"
✅ "Email to John - my accountability partner, we've worked together 2 years, very casual"

### 2. Specify the Outcome

❌ "Follow up email"
✅ "Follow up email - goal is to schedule a call this week"

### 3. Include Relevant History

❌ "Respond to their question"
✅ "Respond to their question about pricing - they mentioned budget is tight in our last call"

### 4. Request Variations

❌ "Write an email"
✅ "Write 3 versions - I'll pick the best one"

## When NOT to Use EA for Email

Your EA drafts. You decide if the draft is right.

**Always review carefully when:**
- Money or contracts involved
- Relationship is new or fragile
- Topic is emotionally charged
- You're making a commitment

**Your EA flags these automatically** if you've set up proper escalation triggers.

## Key Takeaways

1. **EA drafts, you send** - Never remove yourself from the loop
2. **Context = quality** - More context = better drafts
3. **Patterns compound** - Each email pattern you document makes the next one better
4. **Difficult ≠ impossible** - EA can start hard emails, you finish them
