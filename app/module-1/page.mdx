# Module 1: Executive Assistant Agent

Welcome to your first real agent build. The Executive Assistant is the perfect starting point because:

- **Immediate ROI** - You'll save time on tasks you do daily
- **Low risk** - Administrative tasks are easy to review and correct
- **Foundation for others** - Patterns you learn here apply to every agent

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll have:

| Capability | What It Does |

| `/ea-email` command | Draft emails in your voice with one command |
| `/ea-research` command | Get structured research briefs on any topic |
| `/ea-meeting-prep` command | Prepare for meetings with context and talking points |

## The EA Philosophy

Your Executive Assistant agent should:

1. **Free up your time** - Handle tasks that don't need your unique expertise
2. **Maintain your voice** - Sound like you, not like generic AI
3. **Know its limits** - Escalate what requires your judgment
4. **Improve over time** - Get better as you refine instructions

Think: *"What would I tell a new hire on their first day?"*

That's what you're building into this agent.
