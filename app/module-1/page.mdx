# Module 1: Executive Assistant Agent

Your Executive Assistant is the perfect first agent because:

- **Immediate ROI** - You'll save time on tasks you do daily
- **Low risk** - Administrative tasks are easy to review
- **Foundation for others** - Patterns here apply to every agent

## The Three Versions of Your EA

Your EA will evolve through three versions. Start where you're comfortable:

### V0: Manual Context (This Module)

**What it does:**
- Draft email responses (you paste the email, it drafts a reply)
- Research topics (you ask, it researches and summarizes)
- Meeting prep (you provide context, it creates an agenda)

**How it works:**
- You fill out CLAUDE.md with your context
- You invoke the EA when you need it
- Completely reactive - you give it info, it produces output

**Why start here:**
- Understand how Claude Code uses context
- No technical setup required
- See immediate value before investing more

**If this feels tedious** - filling out your communication style, key contacts, and preferences manually - you can skip to V1, where your EA discovers this from your actual email.

---

### V1: Connected (Future Module)

**What it does:**
- Reads your inbox directly
- Discovers your frequent contacts, folders, and patterns
- Asks clarifying questions instead of making you fill out templates
- Files emails, triages your inbox, drafts responses proactively

**How it works:**
- Connect Gmail via MCP (requires some setup)
- EA examines your email and proposes what it learned
- You confirm/adjust, building context collaboratively

**Why upgrade:**
- No more manual context entry
- EA works with your real data
- More proactive, less reactive

---

### V2: Self-Improving (Advanced Module)

**What it does:**
- Compares its drafts to what you actually sent
- Notices when you edit heavily vs. send as-is
- Updates its own instructions based on patterns
- Gets better over time without manual tweaking

**How it works:**
- EA monitors sent folder
- Learns from your edits and preferences
- Writes insights back to its own config

**Why upgrade:**
- The EA improves without you doing anything
- Your preferences are learned, not documented
- Less maintenance over time
