# Installation & Setup

Let's get Claude Code running on your machine. This takes about 10 minutes.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:

1. **Claude Pro or Max subscription** ($20/month)
   - [Sign up at claude.ai](https://claude.ai) if you haven't
   - This gives you API access needed for Claude Code

2. **A terminal**
   - **Mac**: Terminal app (pre-installed) or iTerm2
   - **Windows**: PowerShell or Windows Terminal
   - **Linux**: Any terminal

3. **Node.js installed**
   - Check if you have it: `node --version`
   - If not, [download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

---

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This installs Claude Code globally so you can use it anywhere.

---

## Step 2: Authenticate

Run:

```bash
claude auth
```

This opens a browser window. Log in with your Claude account and authorize the CLI.

---

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Run:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see a version number. If you do, you're set!

---

## Step 4: Create Your Own Copy of the Starter Repo

You'll create your own copy of the starter template - this becomes YOUR AI staff repository that you'll customize throughout the course.

### Option A: Use GitHub Template (Recommended)

1. Go to [github.com/pollymallen/solopreneur-ai-staff](https://github.com/pollymallen/solopreneur-ai-staff)
2. Click the green **"Use this template"** button
3. Name your repo (e.g., `my-ai-staff` or `[your-business]-ai-staff`)
4. Choose **Private** if you want to keep your business context confidential
5. Click **"Create repository"**
6. Clone your new repo:

```bash
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you prefer
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Option B: Quick Clone (For Testing)

If you just want to explore without creating your own repo:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/pollymallen/solopreneur-ai-staff.git
cd solopreneur-ai-staff
```

Note: With Option B, you won't be able to push your changes. Use Option A for the full course experience.

---

## Step 5: Start Claude Code

From inside your project folder:

```bash
claude
```

You should see Claude Code start up. Try saying:

```
Hi! Read the CLAUDE.md file and tell me what this project is about.
```

Claude should read the file and explain the AI staff concept.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: claude"

Node.js global packages aren't in your path. Try:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(npm bin -g)"
```

Or reinstall with:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Authentication failed"

Make sure you have an active Claude Pro or Max subscription. Free tier doesn't include API access.

### "Permission denied"

On Mac/Linux, you may need:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

---

## Your First Conversation

Now that Claude Code is running, try these commands:

```
What files are in this project?
```

```
Read the README.md and summarize it for me
```

```
Create a file called test.txt with "Hello from Claude Code" inside
```

Notice how Claude Code actually creates the file - you can verify it exists!

---

## Key Concept: Project Context

When you run `claude` inside a folder, Claude Code:

1. Reads any `CLAUDE.md` file for context
2. Can access all files in that folder
3. Maintains conversation history for that session

This is why we work inside the `solopreneur-ai-staff` folder - it gives Claude the context it needs.

## Next Up

Now that Claude Code is running, let's learn about its most powerful feature: persistent memory through CLAUDE.md.
