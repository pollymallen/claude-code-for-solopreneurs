# Module 0: Foundations

Welcome to the starting point of your AI staff journey.

Before you can build agents that handle real work in your business, you need to understand the tool that makes it all possible: **Claude Code**.

---

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll:

1. **Understand what Claude Code is** and why it's different from ChatGPT or Claude.ai
2. **Install and set up** your Claude Code environment
3. **Learn about CLAUDE.md** — the "memory" that makes your agents persistent
4. **Master basic commands** for working with Claude Code
5. **Develop the agent mental model** — how to think about AI as staff

---

## Why This Matters

Most people use AI like a search engine: ask a question, get an answer, forget everything.

Claude Code is different. It:

- **Remembers context** across sessions via CLAUDE.md
- **Works with your actual files** — not just text in a chat box
- **Can execute real tasks** — not just suggest what to do
- **Builds on itself** — each agent you create makes the next one easier

This is the difference between "using AI" and "having AI staff."
