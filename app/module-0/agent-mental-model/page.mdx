# The Agent Mental Model

This is the most important lesson in Module 0. Everything else builds on this mindset shift.

## The Shift: Assistant → Agent

Most people use AI like this:

> "AI, help me write an email"
> [AI gives suggestions]
> [Human edits, copies, pastes, sends]

This is the **assistant model**. AI suggests, you do.

The agent model flips this:

> "Email agent: check my inbox, draft responses to anything urgent, save drafts for my review"
> [Agent reads emails, writes drafts, organizes them]
> [Human reviews and approves]

This is the **agent model**. You direct, AI does.

## Why This Matters for Solopreneurs

As a solopreneur, you're bottlenecked. There's more work than hours.

The assistant model doesn't solve this - it just makes you slightly faster at doing the work yourself.

The agent model *actually* delegates. The work gets done whether you're in the loop or not.

## The Components of an Agent

Every agent in your AI staff has:

### 1. Context (CLAUDE.md)
What does this agent know? Your business, voice, preferences, key files.

### 2. Instructions (Agent README)
What is this agent *for*? What tasks does it handle? How should it approach work?

### 3. Tools
What can this agent *use* to take action?

**Built-in capabilities:**
- Read and write files on your computer
- Run terminal commands
- Search the web and fetch pages

**Local programs:**
- Software installed on your computer that Claude can run
- Example: Convert a Word doc to PDF, resize images, process video
- Claude can often install what it needs (with your approval)

**External connections (MCP):**
- Connections to online services like email, Slack, or project management tools
- Example: Actually send an email, create a task in Asana, post to Slack
- These require setup (we'll cover this as we build agents that need them)

**Custom commands:**
- Shortcuts you create for common workflows
- The `/ea-email` and `/cs-respond` commands we build in this course

### 4. Memory
How does this agent remember things?

**Session memory:**
- What you've discussed in the current conversation
- Lost when you exit, summarized when you run `/compact`

**Persistent memory (CLAUDE.md):**
- Always loaded when a session starts
- Your business context, voice, preferences

**Working memory (files):**
- Agents can read and write files to "remember" things
- Example: The FAQ knowledge base, notes, logs, previous outputs
- This is how knowledge compounds over time

### 5. Boundaries
What does this agent NOT do? When should it escalate to you?

---

## Proactive Agents and "Always On"

Here's an important limitation to understand: **Claude Code is reactive by default.** It runs when you invoke it. It's not watching your inbox in the background.

Think of it like a capable employee who works when you call them, not one who's sitting at a desk 24/7.

### Making Agents More Proactive

To approximate "always on" behavior, you need external triggers:

| Approach | How It Works | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Scheduled scripts** | Cron jobs that invoke Claude Code periodically | "Every morning at 8am, check my inbox" |
| **Automation platforms** | Tools like n8n, Zapier, or Make trigger Claude on events | "When a form is submitted, process it" |
| **Hooks** | Claude Code runs scripts in response to certain events | "After every file edit, run linting" |
| **GitHub Actions** | Trigger Claude on code/repo events | "On PR, review the code" |

We'll cover these patterns in later modules as they become relevant. For now, understand that your agents work *when invoked* - the power is in how fast and consistently they work once called.

## Example: Executive Assistant Agent

Let's see these components in action:

### Context
```markdown
# From CLAUDE.md
- Mary runs Clarity Coaching
- Professional but warm brand voice
- Uses Kajabi for email
- Prefers concise communication
```

### Instructions
```markdown
# From /agents/executive-assistant/README.md
You handle:
- Email drafting
- Research tasks
- Meeting preparation
- Data organization

You don't:
- Send emails without approval
- Make commitments on Mary's behalf
- Access sensitive financial files
```

### Tools
```markdown
Built-in: Read files, search web, run commands
Local: pandoc (for document conversion)
External: Gmail MCP (to actually send emails)
Commands: /ea-email, /ea-research, /ea-prep
```

### Memory
```markdown
Persistent: CLAUDE.md (business context, voice)
Working: /drafts folder (email drafts for review)
Working: /research folder (saved research briefs)
```

### Boundaries
```markdown
Always save as draft, never send directly
Flag anything requiring strategic decisions
Ask for clarification if recipient relationship is unclear
```

## Building Your Agent Roster

Think of your agents like a startup team:

| Role | Handles | Escalates |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Executive Assistant** | Admin tasks | Calendar conflicts, sensitive relationships |
| **Customer Success** | Support tickets | Refund requests, complaints |
| **Audience Intelligence** | Research | Strategic implications |
| **Content Team** | Content creation | Brand-sensitive topics, controversy |
| **Marketing Strategist** | Campaign planning | Budget decisions, partnerships |

Each agent has a clear domain. Overlaps are intentional - Content Creator checks with Audience Intelligence before writing.

---

## The Hierarchy

Later in the course, we'll build agent hierarchies:

```
You (CEO)
  └── Marketing Strategist (makes decisions)
        └── Content Strategist (plans)
              └── Content Creator (executes)
        └── Audience Intelligence (researches)
  └── Executive Assistant (admin)
  └── Customer Success (support)
```

Strategic agents direct operational agents. You direct strategic agents.

This is Module 5-6 territory. For now, just understand the concept.

## Exercise: Define Your First Agent

Before moving to Module 1, think about your Executive Assistant:

1. **What tasks eat your time?**
   - Email responses?
   - Research?
   - Scheduling prep?

2. **What context does the agent need?**
   - Your communication style?
   - Key relationships?
   - Recurring topics?

3. **What should it NOT do?**
   - Send without approval?
   - Access certain files?
   - Make promises?

Write these answers somewhere - you'll use them in Module 1.

---

## Module 0 Complete!

You now understand:
- ✅ What Claude Code is and why it's different
- ✅ How to install and authenticate
- ✅ How CLAUDE.md creates persistent memory
- ✅ Basic commands and workflows
- ✅ The agent mental model: context, instructions, tools, memory, boundaries
- ✅ What agents can and can't do (reactive by default, proactive with triggers)

---

## What's Next

In Module 1, you'll build your first real agent: the **Executive Assistant**.

This is where theory becomes practice. You'll:
- Design EA agent instructions
- Create custom commands
- Handle real email and research tasks
- Experience the leverage of working with an agent

## Optional: Share Your CLAUDE.md

Before moving on, make sure your CLAUDE.md is filled in with your actual business context. The rest of the course assumes this is done.

If you're stuck, try this prompt in Claude Code:

```
Help me write my CLAUDE.md. Ask me questions about my business,
then draft a complete CLAUDE.md for me.
```

Claude will interview you and create the file.
