# Basic Commands

Now that you understand CLAUDE.md, let's learn how to actually work with Claude Code day-to-day.

---

## Starting and Stopping

### Start a session
```bash
claude
```
Run this inside your project folder.

### End a session
Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C`

### Clear conversation
```
/clear
```
Keeps the session but forgets the conversation. CLAUDE.md context is preserved.

---

## Working with Files

### Read a file
```
Read the file /templates/email-response.md
```

Or simply:
```
What's in the templates folder?
```

Claude Code understands natural language.

### Create a file
```
Create a file called notes.md with today's meeting notes: [your notes]
```

### Edit a file
```
In the file CLAUDE.md, add "Podcast publishes Tuesdays" to the Key Context section
```

### Find files
```
Find all markdown files in the agents folder
```

---

## Getting Information

### Research
```
Research the top 3 pain points for coaches who want to scale their business
```

### Summarize
```
Summarize the last 10 emails in my client-communications folder
```

### Analyze
```
Analyze my content-calendar.md and identify gaps in my content themes
```

---

## Custom Commands (Slash Commands)

You can create shortcuts for common tasks. These live in `.claude/commands/`.

### Example: Email drafting command

Create a file `.claude/commands/email.md`:

```markdown
# Email Command

Draft a professional email based on these inputs:
- Recipient: $RECIPIENT
- Purpose: $PURPOSE

Use my brand voice from CLAUDE.md. Provide 2 versions: short and detailed.
```

Now you can use:
```
/email to: Sarah, purpose: follow up on coaching discovery call
```

We'll build custom commands for each agent in later modules.

## Useful Built-in Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/compact` | Summarize conversation to save context |
| `/usage` | Show token usage for session |

---

## Approval Prompts

Claude Code asks for permission before:
- Creating or modifying files
- Running terminal commands
- Accessing external resources

You'll see prompts like:
```
Claude wants to create file: notes.md
[Allow] [Deny] [Allow All]
```

**Tip:** "Allow All" for a session if you're doing trusted work. Always review what Claude is creating.

---

## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be specific about output
❌ "Write some content"
✅ "Write a LinkedIn post about [topic], 150 words, conversational tone"

### Reference your context
❌ "Write in my brand voice"
✅ "Using the brand voice from CLAUDE.md, write..."

### Give examples
❌ "Make it good"
✅ "Here's an example of the style I like: [example]"

### Chain tasks
```
First, read my latest blog post. Then, create 5 Twitter threads from it. Save each as a separate file in /content/twitter/
```

## Exercise: Basic Workflow

Try this complete workflow:

1. **Start Claude Code** in your starter repo
2. **Ask Claude to read** your CLAUDE.md
3. **Create a file**: "Create a file called practice/first-email.md with a welcome email to a new subscriber"
4. **Edit it**: "Make the email more casual and add a PS about my podcast"
5. **Review the result**

You just completed your first full Claude Code workflow!

## What's Next

You now know how to:
- Start Claude Code with context
- Work with files
- Use basic commands
- Craft effective prompts

The last piece is the most important: thinking about Claude as an *agent* rather than an *assistant*.
