# Basic Commands

Now that you understand CLAUDE.md, let's learn how to actually work with Claude Code day-to-day.

---

## Starting and Stopping

### Start a session
```bash
claude
```
Run this inside your project folder. Your CLAUDE.md files are loaded automatically.

### End a session
Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C`

---

## Working with Files

### Read a file
```
Read the file /templates/email-response.md
```

Or simply:
```
What's in the templates folder?
```

Claude Code understands natural language.

### Create a file
```
Create a file called notes.md with today's meeting notes: [your notes]
```

### Edit a file
```
In the file CLAUDE.md, add "Podcast publishes Tuesdays" to the Key Context section
```

### Find files
```
Find all markdown files in the agents folder
```

---

## Getting Information

### Research
```
Research the top 3 pain points for coaches who want to scale their business
```

### Summarize
```
Summarize the last 10 emails in my client-communications folder
```

### Analyze
```
Analyze my content-calendar.md and identify gaps in my content themes
```

## Useful Built-in Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/compact` | Summarize conversation to save context |
| `/clear` | Completely forget the conversation |
| `/usage` | Show token usage for session |

### `/compact` vs `/clear`

Claude Code has a limited "context window" - the amount of conversation it can remember at once. As you work on longer tasks, you'll approach this limit.

**`/compact`** - Summarizes the conversation, keeping key information but freeing up space. Claude Code runs this automatically when you're running low on context. Use it manually when switching tasks but want to retain useful context.

**`/clear`** - Complete memory wipe of the conversation. Use when you want a totally fresh start with no prior context. Your CLAUDE.md files stay loaded (they're not part of the conversation).

For most situations, `/compact` is what you want.

For the full list of built-in commands, see the [official slash commands documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands).

## Custom Commands (Slash Commands)

You can create your own shortcuts for common tasks. These live in `.claude/commands/`.

### Example: Email drafting command

Create a file `.claude/commands/email.md`:

```markdown
# Email Command

Draft a professional email based on these inputs:
- Recipient: $RECIPIENT
- Purpose: $PURPOSE

Use my brand voice from CLAUDE.md. Provide 2 versions: short and detailed.
```

Now you can use:
```
/email to: Sarah, purpose: follow up on coaching discovery call
```

We'll build custom commands for each agent in later modules.

---

## Approval Prompts

Claude Code asks for permission before:
- Creating or modifying files
- Running terminal commands
- Accessing external resources

You'll see prompts like:
```
Claude wants to create file: notes.md
[Allow] [Deny] [Allow All]
```

**Tip:** "Allow All" for a session if you're doing trusted work. Always review what Claude is creating.

## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be specific about output
❌ "Write some content"
✅ "Write a LinkedIn post about [topic], 150 words, conversational tone"

### Reference your context
❌ "Write in my brand voice"
✅ "Using the brand voice from CLAUDE.md, write..."

### Give examples
❌ "Make it good"
✅ "Here's an example of the style I like: [example]"

### Chain tasks
```
First, read my latest blog post. Then, create 5 Twitter threads from it. Save each as a separate file in /content/twitter/
```

---

## Exercise: Basic Workflow

Try this complete workflow:

1. **Start Claude Code** in your starter repo (CLAUDE.md is loaded automatically)
2. **Create a file**: "Create a file called practice/first-email.md with a welcome email to a new subscriber"
3. **Edit it**: "Make the email more casual and add a PS about my podcast"
4. **Review the result**

You just completed your first full Claude Code workflow!

## What's Next

You now know how to:
- Start Claude Code with context
- Work with files
- Use basic commands
- Craft effective prompts

The last piece is the most important: thinking about Claude as an *agent* rather than an *assistant*.
