# CLAUDE.md & Project Memory

The secret to making AI feel like "staff" instead of "tool" is **persistent memory**. CLAUDE.md is how you give Claude Code that memory.

## What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude Code reads automatically at the start of every session. Think of it as:

- Your business's "employee handbook" for AI
- Context that carries across conversations
- The shared brain for all your agents

When you open Claude Code in a folder containing CLAUDE.md, it reads it first - before you say anything.

---

## Why This Matters

Without CLAUDE.md:
```
You: "Write an email to a client"
Claude: "Sure! What's your business? What tone should I use? What's the context?"
```

With CLAUDE.md:
```
You: "Write an email to a client about our coaching program"
Claude: [Already knows your business, tone, program details - just writes the email]
```

The difference is **leverage**. You're not re-explaining context every time.

## Anatomy of a Good CLAUDE.md

Open your starter repo's CLAUDE.md. Here's what each section does:

### Business Overview

```markdown
**Business Name:** Clarity Coaching
**What You Do:** Help overwhelmed entrepreneurs create systems for sustainable growth
**Target Audience:** Solopreneurs making $100k-$500k who want to scale without burning out
**Core Offer:** 12-week 1:1 coaching program ($5,000)
```

This context shapes every response. An email about your "coaching program" will automatically reference the right details.

### Brand Voice

```markdown
**Tone:** Professional but warm - like a trusted mentor
**Personality:** Calm, confident, occasionally playful
**Words to Use:** "sustainable," "clarity," "systems," "freedom"
**Words to Avoid:** "hustle," "grind," "crush it," "killing it"
```

Now every piece of content sounds like *you* wrote it.

### Key Context

```markdown
- We use Kajabi for courses and email
- Podcast publishes every Tuesday
- Currently launching new group program in Q2
```

Operational details that affect recommendations and content.

## Exercise: Fill In Your CLAUDE.md

Open your starter repo and edit CLAUDE.md with your actual business details.

Start with just the basics:

1. **Business Overview** - Who you are and what you do
2. **Brand Voice** - How you communicate
3. **One key fact** - Something important Claude should always remember

Don't overthink it. You can add more later. The goal is to get *something* in there.

---

## Testing Your Memory

After editing CLAUDE.md, restart Claude Code and try:

```
Based on my CLAUDE.md, describe my business in one sentence.
```

Claude should accurately describe your business. If it doesn't, your CLAUDE.md needs more clarity.

Then try:

```
Write a welcome email to a new subscriber
```

Notice how it uses your brand voice without being asked.

## Advanced: Multiple CLAUDE.md Files

You can have CLAUDE.md files in different folders for different contexts:

```
/solopreneur-ai-staff/
  CLAUDE.md                    # Global context
  /agents/executive-assistant/
    CLAUDE.md                  # EA-specific instructions
  /projects/podcast/
    CLAUDE.md                  # Podcast-specific context
```

Claude Code reads the CLAUDE.md in the folder you're in, plus any in parent folders.

## Common Mistakes

### Too vague
❌ "We help people with business stuff"
✅ "We help service-based solopreneurs price their offers confidently"

### Too long
❌ 10 pages of every detail about your business
✅ The essential context needed for most tasks (1-2 pages max)

### Never updated
❌ Set it once and forget it
✅ Update when your business evolves

---

## Key Takeaway

CLAUDE.md is the foundation of your AI staff. A well-crafted CLAUDE.md means:

- Less explaining, more doing
- Consistent voice across all agents
- Context that compounds over time

Time invested here pays dividends in every future interaction.
