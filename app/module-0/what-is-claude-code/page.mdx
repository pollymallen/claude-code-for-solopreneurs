# What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you work with Claude AI directly in your terminal. But that description undersells what makes it special.

## The Problem with Chat-Based AI

When you use ChatGPT or Claude.ai in a browser, you're limited:

- **No memory** - Start fresh every conversation
- **No files** - Can't work with your actual documents
- **No actions** - AI can only suggest, not do
- **Copy-paste hell** - Manually moving content back and forth

This is fine for quick questions. It's terrible for real work.

## What Makes Claude Code Different

Claude Code runs in your terminal, which means:

### 1. It Works with Real Files

```
"Read my client-emails folder and draft responses to any urgent ones"
```

Claude Code actually reads your files, understands context, and creates new files. No copy-pasting.

### 2. It Remembers Everything

Through `CLAUDE.md` (more on this later), Claude Code maintains context across sessions. It knows your business, your brand voice, your preferences.

### 3. It Takes Action

Claude Code doesn't just suggest code - it writes files, runs commands, and executes tasks. You approve each action, but the AI does the work.

### 4. It Can Run Multiple Agents

Need research done while also drafting content? Claude Code can spawn parallel "sub-agents" that work simultaneously.

## The Mental Shift

Stop thinking: *"AI assistant I chat with"*

Start thinking: *"Staff member who works in my system"*

This is the difference between:
- Asking ChatGPT to "help me write an email"
- Telling your EA agent to "check my inbox and draft responses"

The second version is what we're building in this course.

## Who Uses Claude Code?

Originally built for developers, Claude Code is increasingly used by:

- **Solopreneurs** - Building AI staff for their business
- **Content creators** - Automating content workflows
- **Consultants** - Creating custom AI solutions for clients
- **Knowledge workers** - Anyone who processes information for a living

You don't need to code. You need to think in systems.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have:

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| Executive Assistant | Email, research, scheduling |
| Customer Success | Support, FAQs, onboarding |
| Audience Intelligence | ICP research, competitive analysis |
| Content Strategist | Planning, calendars |
| Content Creator | Writing, repurposing |
| Marketing Strategist | Campaigns, positioning |

Each agent remembers your context, speaks in your voice, and works with your actual files.
